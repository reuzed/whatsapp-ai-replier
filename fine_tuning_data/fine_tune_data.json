They have to understand and reason about paths that don't matter.\n\n**Maintenance burden**: Those 90 lines are potential bugs, need updates when things change, and make the actual logic harder to find and modify.\n\n**Testing surface**: Fewer code paths to test means higher confidence in what you *do* have.\n\n**The key insight**: You identified that the complexity wasn't solving a real problem\u2014it was just... there. That's often harder to spot than obvious bugs because the code is \"working.\"\n\nThis is different from premature optimization (which is bad) because you're not sacrificing functionality\u2014you're removing code that wasn't doing anything.
